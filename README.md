Introduction:
Welcome to the analysis of the Superstore e-commerce dataset. This dataset contains information about orders, returns, and customers, providing valuable insights into the sales performance and customer behavior of the Superstore.
Problem Statement:
Our objective is to analyze the Superstore e-commerce data and create meaningful visualizations to gain insights into various aspects such as sales trends, return rates, customer demographics, and regional performance. We will utilize Tableau to build interactive dashboards and charts, allowing for in-depth exploration of the dataset.
Dataset Overview:
The Superstore dataset comprises three main sheets:
Orders Sheet: Contains information about orders placed in the Superstore, including order ID, order date, customer ID, customer name, region, city, country, product details , name, category, sub-category, shipping date, sales, discounts, profits, etc.
Returns Sheet: Provides details about returned orders, including the order ID and whether the order was returned.
People Sheet: Contains information about customers, including their names and regions.
Analysis Approach:
Sales Analysis: We will analyze sales trends over time, identify top-selling products/categories, and explore sales performance across regions.
Return Analysis: We will examine return rates, reasons for returns, and their impact on profitability.
Customer Analysis: We will analyze customer demographics, such as distribution by region and customer segments, and explore their purchasing behavior.


Dashboard Overview:
The dashboard will offer an integrated view of various aspects of the Superstore e-commerce dataset, including sales trends, return analysis, and customer insights. By consolidating all visualizations into one dashboard, users can quickly gain insights and make informed decisions.
